privmem
=======
Use eclipse and follow the guide:
http://wala.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/UserGuide:Getting_Started
to set up wala.

Import privmem from:
git://github.com/andreasDalsgaard/privmem.git

Unit tests to run test cases can be found in ScjMemoryScopeAnalysisTest.java. It is required that the jar files of the test cases are placed in: ../../papers/mrascj/experiments/ relative to the eclipse working space.

In the data directory the source code of the test cases can be found in the mrascj-testcases tarball. The file privmemScj.jar contain stub classes needed to run the analysis without a SCJ implementation.
