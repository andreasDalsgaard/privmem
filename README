privmem
=======
Use eclipse and follow the guide:
http://wala.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/UserGuide:Getting_Started
to set up wala.

Import privmem from:
git://github.com/andreasDalsgaard/privmem.git

Import launchers from the imported git repository. 
Adapt the SWTPointsTo configuration based on the ScjMemoryScopeAnalysis configuration(gives me strange errors - will have to look into that later)
Use Run Configurations to run the adapted SWTPointsTo configuration
